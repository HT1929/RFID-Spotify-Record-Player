# RFID-Spotify-Record-Player
Instead of vinyl records, RFID chips embedded in custom-made mini-records will trigger specific Spotify songs via a Raspberry Pi. The system mimics the action of placing a record on a turntable, offering both a visual spinning effect and the vast music library of Spotify.

# Project Overview
The RFID Spotify Record Player allows users to:
- Play, pause, skip and control volume for Spotify tracks.
- Select songs or playlists through a physical interface using the RFID sensor.
- Output audio through a built-in speaker system.
- Watch a disk spin as if it were playing a vinyl record, adding to the aesthetic of a traditional record player.
